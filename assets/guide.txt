We need to change
* APP-DOMAIN in config file.
* firebase setup (google json)
* package name
* logo 


Use this commands :
1.  chmod +x modify_contents.sh
2.  ./modify_contents.sh "app_name" "new_package_name" "current_package_name"

than it will generate the build file.





//Not in use-----
1.  The App Logo for each client is kept at assets/{CLIENT_APP_NAME}/icon_name.png

2.  The google-services.json file for each client is kept at assets/{CLIENT_APP_NAME}/google-services.json which will be moved to shopifyappbuilder/android/app/google-services.json

3.  The config file for each client is kept at assets/{CLIENT_APP_NAME}/app_settings.json which will be moved to shopifyappbuilder/assets/cfg/app_settings.json

4.  The Info.plist for each client is kept at assets/{CLIENT_APP_NAME}/Info.plist which will be moved to shopifyappbuilder/ios/Runner/Info.plist



Use this commands :
1.  chmod +x modify_contents.sh
2.  ./modify_contents.sh <app_name> <new_package_name> <current_package_name>"



than it will generate the build file.
